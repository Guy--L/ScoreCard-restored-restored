ICO Global ScoreCard project 

Global KPI ScoreCard designed and implemented to avoid merging and sharing of spreadsheets. This single web page provides real-time updating and roll-up across multiple organizations every fiscal year. Users edit numbers they own on a cellular granularity. Top managers can simply watch the numbers roll in at the deadline with an open browser page.
